\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Audio probing has been used for tens of years in various ways to inspect 
environment and objects that cannot be seen directly. Sonar is used by vessels 
to leverage sound propagation 
time to detect underwater objects. Ultrasonography uses ultrasound to generate
diagnostic imaging of subcutaneous body structures in clinics. Moreover, 
as an ubiquitous sensor, acoustic signals also have been investigated a lot as 
an input to infer our physical world.

% To learn the environment, computer vision techniques has been proposed to capture 
% and reconstruct things from video and images, such as objects 
% \cite{rothganger20063d}, scenes \cite{snavely2006photo}, and buildings 
% \cite{furukawa2009reconstructing}. These techniques require fairly amount of 
% data and heavy post-processing computation. In addition, depth information from 
% RGB-D cameras are used to enable interactive real time 3D visual modeling, 
% especially while RGB-D sensors are getting cheaper, such as Microsoft Kinect 
% \cite{du2011interactive, izadi2011kinectfusion}.


% However, RGB-D cameras are still not available for most people. And privacy 
% concerns could be raised when reconstructing visual model of open spaces, 
% especially in indoor environment, where private information can be more 
% heterogeneous compared to outdoor situation. More importantly, not all 
% applications actually require accurate and complete model of environment. 
% For example, with the knowledge of floor plan, we can infer what a person

%Standing in front of projection screen implies she/he is presenting, 


We propose to use acoustic echo to probe the environment, and build coarse 3D model 
of the environment. Microphones and speakers are available on almost all phones, 
which makes crowd-sourcing possible. And 
sensing the echo of a sound pulse will bring up almost no privacy concerns. We are 
trying to look at how accurate we can achieve to reconstruct 3D in-room model, and 
how much benefits we can introduce to existing techniques.
