\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Knowing the environment is of great importance to bring intelligence into our lives. 
In indoor environments, environment awareness includes information such as size of 
current room, surrounding objects, 3D visual model. \fxnote{applications}


To learn the environment, computer vision techniques has been proposed to capture 
and reconstruct things from video and images, such as objects 
\cite{rothganger20063d}, scenes \cite{snavely2006photo}, and buildings 
\cite{furukawa2009reconstructing}. These techniques require fairly amount of 
data and heavy post-processing computation. In addition, depth information from 
RGB-D cameras are used to enable interactive real time 3D visual modeling, 
especially while RGB-D sensors are getting cheaper, such as Microsoft Kinect 
\cite{du2011interactive, izadi2011kinectfusion}.


However, RGB-D cameras are still not available for most people. And privacy 
concerns could be raised when reconstructing visual model of open spaces, 
especially in indoor environment, where private information can be more 
heterogeneous compared to outdoor situation. More importantly, not all 
applications actually require accurate and complete model of environment. 
For example, with the knowledge of floor plan, we can infer what a person 
is doing simply by acquiring a coarse estimation of her/his location. 
%Standing in front of projection screen implies she/he is presenting, 


We propose to use acoustic echo to probe the environment, and build coarse 3D model 
of the environment. Microphones and speakers are available on almost all phones, 
which makes crowd-sourcing possible. And 
sensing the echo of a sound pulse will bring up almost no privacy concerns. We are 
trying to look at how accurate we can achieve to reconstruct 3D in-room model, and 
how much benefits we can introduce to existing techniques.
