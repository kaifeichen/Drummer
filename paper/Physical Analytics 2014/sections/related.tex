\subsection{Zee}
It use trajectory on map to do enhanced particle filter


Room is not accesable on map, no specific trajectory in room


we can locate in room
we can hear



\subsection{Walkie Markie}
use wifi ap (stronget point) location as input to kalman filter.



\subsection{UnLoc}
use special sensor pattern to feed filter.

Too oppotunistic
No Fingerprint guarantee



\subsection{SLAM}

no camera, no laser
