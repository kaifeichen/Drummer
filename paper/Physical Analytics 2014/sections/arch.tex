The system archtecture of Drummer is shown in figure \ref{fig:arch}. The mobile phone drummer 
client keeps minimum work and offload data and computation to the cloud, assuming we always
have good network connectivity to stream audio data. Tackling with bad network conditions 
\cite{cuervo2010maui} and optimizing audio streaming \cite{farleycsense} are also important 
problems, but they are outside the scope of this paper.
