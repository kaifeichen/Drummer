\subsection{Implementation Issues}

Off-The-Shelf speaker cannot send large range chirp


Android Phone cannot send and listen. We use two phones to emulate.



\subsection{One Surface Ranging}

\fxnote{GRAPH: accuracy at different distance}

\subsection{In-room Ranging}

\fxnote{GRAPH: accuracy at different locations in different size of rooms}


\subsection{3D Modeling}

\subsection{Localization}

Application includes location-based activity recognition

Activity inference based on location. Such as watching TV on couch, working on desk, sleeping on bed.
