\subsection{Implementation Details}

Off-The-Shelf speaker cannot send large range chirp


Android Phone cannot send and listen. We use two phones to emulate.



\subsection{Distance Measurement}

\fxnote{GRAPH: accuracy, consistency at different distance, orientation}


% \subsection{In-room Ranging}

% \fxnote{GRAPH: accuracy at different locations in different size of rooms}


% \subsection{3D Modeling}


% \fxnote{GRAPH: 3D room map and 3D model}


\subsection{Room Change Detection}

\fxnote{GRAPH: true positive, false positive number}


\subsection{Localization}

Application includes location-based activity recognition

Activity inference based on location. Such as watching TV on couch, working on desk, sleeping on bed.
