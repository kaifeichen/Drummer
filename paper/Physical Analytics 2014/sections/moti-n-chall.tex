\subsection{Motivation}

3D modeling/inroom localization

We only focus on closed environment

Video: Privacy, Energy Consumption, Computation, Availability


\subsection{Challenges}

Alignment is not a problem we worry about


\subsubsection{Single Distance Measurement}

To achieve the final goal of reconstructing 3D environment model, 
we need to measure distances of different objects (e.g. walls, desks, chairs).
The first problem to tackle is to measure distance from a single wall. 
For example, how to measure or determine the echo in the recorded audio trace?



\subsubsection{Multiple Distance Measurement}

Then we need to generalize the distance measurements to closed environment 
where reflections and multi-path can bring lost of noise.



\subsubsection{Direction Identification}

Besides the distance of objects around the phone, knowing the direction of the 
object is also very crucial to build the 3D model.
