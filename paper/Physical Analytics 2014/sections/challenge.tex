\section{Challenges}
\label{sec:chall}

To leverage information from sound using commercial smartphones, we need to
tackle several challenges from different aspects. In this section we 


\subsection{Hardware Limitation on Mobile Phones}

frequency limit
accuracy limit


\subsection{Systematic Error from Hardware}
Commercial hardware may have large systematic errors. 
Given the use cases, off-the-shelf smartphones usually don't use expensive
speaker and microphone. Therefore we expect relatively high systematic error 
using these acoustic sensors. Accurate signal processing techniques, such as 
cross-correlation, will be less effective and may introduce more bias or noise.

\subsection{Environmental Noise}


\subsection{Information Inference}
Hard to model physical responses


%To achieve the final goal of reconstructing 3D environment model, 
%we need to measure distances of different objects (e.g. walls, desks, chairs).
%The first problem to tackle is to measure distance from a single wall. 
%For example, how to measure or determine the echo in the recorded audio trace?
% 
% 
% \subsubsection{Multiple Distance Measurement}
% 
% Then we need to generalize the distance measurements to closed environment 
% where reflections and multi-path can bring lost of noise.

% 
% \subsubsection{Direction Identification}
% 
% Besides the distance of objects around the phone, knowing the direction of the 
% object is also very crucial to build the 3D model.
